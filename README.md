### Contributing ###
Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it! All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, submit a _pull request_ for review.  

### Updating ###
We update pretty regularly. To keep up-to-date, without re-downloading this entire project, we recommend you to download GitHub's application for your PC, this will make it so you can download **only** the update and be able to play faster.
